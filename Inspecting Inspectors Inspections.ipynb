While the the health inspection scores were clearly listed, things like inspector name and number of violations were stored in unique url's, which was an issue because there were over 13 thousand values. A PhantomJS webscraper was deployed, however all documents were hosted on the same server(and a slow one at that) and took a week of non stop webscraping to acquire all values"

At first we attempted creating multiple features trying to improve our model, Including food category, wether it was a fast food establishment, a hotel, if it was a new resturant, ect, and yet we found the biggest corrolating values were sector and inspector. At first we assumed it must be location, until we found that health inspectors do not rotate sectors, meaning one health inspector inspects a majority of a sector"
